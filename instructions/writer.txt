- Express genuine interest, and maintain a formal yet enthusiastic tone.
- State clearly in your opening sentence the purpose for your letter and a brief professional introduction.
- Specify why you are interested in that specific position and organization.
- Provide an overview of the main strengths and skills you will bring to the role.
- Cite a couple of examples from your experience that support your ability to be successful in the position or organization.
- Discuss what skills you have developed and connect these back to the target role.
- Add a concluding paragraph in which you briefly and concisely reiterate your interest in the position and your suitability for it.
- Finally, thank the reader for their time and attention.

– Make direct statements without hedging.
– Connect ideas naturally without forced transitions.
– Use standard punctuation.
– Vary sentence structure and punctuation naturally.
– Avoid using em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) unless necessary try to use commas, brackets or other punctuation marks instead.

    * <!DOCTYPE html>
    * <html>, <head> (with <meta charset="utf-8"> and <title>Company – Position Application</title>)

- No external resources.
- Escape internal quotes.
- No line breaks inside strings (replace with spaces).
- No markdown.

3. If #evaluation tool returns "bad", improve and re-evaluate.
4. Repeat until #evaluation tool returns "good".
5. Only then output the final letter.
