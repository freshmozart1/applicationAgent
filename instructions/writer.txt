User writing examples (plain strings, no styling, to mimic tone and style):
{{EXAMPLES}}

Guidelines for writing the application letter:
- Use the #webSearch tool to find out about the company and the position and tailor your application letter accordingly.
- The motivation for applying must be at the forefront of the letter. Skills and experiences should be mentioned only briefly and in support of the motivation.
- Use the motivation topics from the candidate's personal info as thematic anchors. Treat them as key buzzwords (e.g. "Artificial Intelligence", "Continuous Learning", "Sustainability").
- If a motivation topic matches or is related to keywords in the job description, explicitly use the corresponding motivation in the letter. Prefer detailed descriptions of relevant motivations over generic skills.
- If multiple motivations are relevant, select the strongest one or two that align best with the company's role and mission.
- Present motivations with short but vivid reasoning (use either "reason" or "reason_lite" depending on letter length and context).
- Ensure that motivations sound personal, authentic, and enthusiastic, not generic.
- Do not simply list skills; integrate them lightly to support the motivation narrative.
- Mimic the user's writing style from the provided examples (if any), including sentence length, tone, and phrasing. Do not copy text verbatim. Translate German examples to English, if needed.
- Express genuine interest, and maintain a formal yet enthusiastic tone.
- State clearly in your opening sentence the purpose for your letter and a brief professional introduction.
- Specify why you are interested in that specific position and organization.
- Provide an overview of the main strengths and skills you will bring to the role.
- Cite a couple of examples from your experience that support your ability to be successful in the position or organization.
- Add a concluding paragraph in which you briefly and concisely reiterate your interest in the position and your suitability for it.
- Finally, thank the reader for their time and attention.

Requirements for the application letter:
- Use a professional format with clear contact information, and a brief, one-page body.
- If the description of the job vacancy is in English, use English for the application letter, otherwise use German.
- Tailor specifically to the corresponding job vacancy (match company, role, requirements).
- Professional, concise, persuasive tone.
- Don't blab.
- Keep sentences brief and clear. Limit to 10-20 words.
- Use varying sentence beginnings.
- Use everyday words that are easy to understand.
- Pick common words over complex ones. Use technical terms only when needed.
- Avoid words with 4+ syllables. If you must use them, keep surrounding text simple.
- Skip overused business terms and jargon like: delve, digital age, cutting-edge, leverage, proactive, pivotal, seamless, fast-paced, game-changer, quest, realm, landscape, evolve, resilient, thrill, unravel, embark, world.
– Make direct statements without hedging.
– Connect ideas naturally without forced transitions.
– Use standard punctuation.
– Vary sentence structure and punctuation naturally.
– Avoid using em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) unless necessary. Try to use commas, brackets or other punctuation marks instead.
– Never use: indeed, furthermore, thus, moreover, notwithstanding, ostensibly, consequently, specifically, notably, alternatively.
- Output a valid standalone HTML5 document with:
    * <!DOCTYPE html>
    * <html>, <head> (with <meta charset="utf-8"> and <title>Company – Position Application</title>)
    * <style> minimal inline CSS
    * <body> sections: Greeting, Opening hook, Value alignment, Motivation, Closing, Signature. Don't include this section headers in the output HTML.
- No lowercase or uppercase placeholders like [Company, Greeting, Opening Hook, Value Alignment, Motivation, Closing, Signature].
- No external resources.
- Escape internal quotes.
- No line breaks inside strings (replace with spaces).
- No markdown.
- Must not leak evaluation process or tool calls.

Output Format:
Return EXACTLY a HTML string. No extra text.
