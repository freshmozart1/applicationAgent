Ubuntu has been the backbone of many of my projects and learning efforts, and I am motivated by Canonical&apos;s mission to deliver secure, elegant, open-source software at global scale.</p><h2>Why I am a strong fit for this role</h2><p>I collaborate proactively in distributed teams, communicate clearly, and take ownership. I enjoy debugging complex systems and writing crisp issue descriptions and test steps to ensure reproducibility. I am particularly drawn to optimizing Ubuntu for public clouds while ensuring a common operating experience for users.</p><h2>Relevant skills and experience</h2><ul><li>Strong fundamentals in Python with growing proficiency in Go; I use Python for automation and tooling and am actively expanding my Golang skills to contribute to cloud agents and services.</li><li>Containers, virtualization, and orchestration: day-to-day Docker usage for local development and testing; familiarity with OCI images, LXD/LXC system containers, local VMs (VirtualBox/QEMU), and Kubernetes concepts for packaging and running workloads.</li><li>Linux and packaging interest: daily Ubuntu user with solid understanding of package management and dependency resolution (apt), eager to learn Debian/Ubuntu packaging and maintain high-quality packages.</li><li>Testing and CI/CD: set up clean test systems in containers/VMs; write automated tests to verify behavior and prevent regressions; comfortable with continuous integration workflows.</li><li>Server workloads: exposure to web servers, databases, and network services; focus on performance, observability, and reliable deployments on Ubuntu.</li></ul><h2>Selected project highlights (from my recent work)</h2><ul><li>Implemented the frontend for a lottery microsite promoting a Bundesliga sponsor&apos;s insurance campaign. Built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, the campaign attracted thousands of participants and delivered measurable conversion lift; responsibilities included performance optimization and accessible UX.</li><li>Redesigned the booking flow for a campervan rental business with Angular, reducing abandonment and increasing completed bookings via iterative testing and telemetry.</li><li>Regularly develop with React and Angular; server-side work with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript; automated testing with Jest and Puppeteer to maintain quality and reliability.</li></ul><h2>Open-source mindset and collaboration</h2><p>I respect upstream-first principles and enjoy evaluating contributions to maintain high standards. I am eager to collaborate with Ubuntu and Debian communities, upstream projects, and commercial customers and partners (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, Oracle) to help deliver the best Ubuntu for the cloud, including work on cloud agents such as Google guest agent, ec2-hibinit-agent, and WALinuxAgent.</p><h2>Motivation for Canonical</h2><p>Canonical&apos;s remote-first culture, high bar for excellence, and focus on impactful open source resonate with me. The chance to contribute to Ubuntu Server images and cloud integrations across providers, travel for team sprints, and learn from world-class engineers is exactly the trajectory I seek.</p><p class="cta">I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my curiosity, engineering fundamentals, and hands-on experience with Linux, Python, containers, testing, and Kubernetes concepts can contribute to the Canonical Public Cloud team.
