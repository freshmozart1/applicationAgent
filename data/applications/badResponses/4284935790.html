I am a full‑stack engineer with a strong focus on software quality, automation, and measurable impact. My daily work is grounded in modern JavaScript engineering, and I am eager to bring that quality mindset to Ubuntu release engineering and expand it across CI, test automation, and analytics.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">In a recent engagement for a Bundesliga main sponsor, I led the frontend for a lottery website that promoted an insurance product for football fans. The campaign attracted thousands of participants and measurably increased new policies during the promotion months. For a campervan rental company, I redesigned the entire booking flow with Angular, implementing a user‑friendly funnel that clearly reduced abandonment and increased completed bookings.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Technically, I work with React and Angular on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the server. I use TypeScript to enhance code quality and maintainability. To ensure reliability, I build automated tests with Jest and Puppeteer, including end‑to‑end scenarios that mirror real user journeys. I enjoy troubleshooting complex issues collaboratively and turning findings into robust tests and guardrails.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">I am drawn to Canonical because of its leadership in open source and the high bar for quality across Ubuntu Desktop, Server, and Core. The prospect of contributing to continuous integration that protects image, release, and package quality, establishing actionable KPIs, and automating tests from unit‑ to end‑to‑end multi‑machine workloads is deeply motivating. I value distributed, asynchronous collaboration and clear written communication, and I thrive in environments that expect excellence and continuous learning.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">While my background is rooted in full‑stack JavaScript, my professional focus on test automation, meticulous debugging, and data‑informed decision making translates directly to this QA engineering role. I am committed to deepening my tooling in Python and shell for test orchestration, and to learning Debian packaging and snaps, so I can contribute effectively to Canonical&#39;s release engineering and quality goals.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in designing reliable, automated test suites and my motivation to grow within Linux QA can support Canonical&#39;s mission to deliver secure, high‑quality open source software at global scale.</p><p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">Thank you for your time and consideration.</p><p style="margin:0;">Kind regards,<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">[Applicant Name]</span></p></section><section style="margin-top:8px;border-top:1px solid #eee;padding-top:12px;font-size:14px;color:#444;"><p style="margin:0 0 6px 0;font-weight:bold;color:#111;">Highlights relevant to the role</p><ul style="margin:0 0 0 18px;padding:0;list-style:disc;"><li style="margin:6px 0;">Built end‑to‑end automated tests with Jest and Puppeteer; translated production issues into repeatable test cases and regressions.</li><li style="margin:6px 0;">Delivered measurable outcomes: increased policy sign‑ups for a Bundesliga sponsor campaign; reduced booking abandonment with an Angular booking flow redesign.</li><li style="margin:6px 0;">Strong collaboration and troubleshooting skills; comfortable partnering across teams to identify, isolate, and resolve issues.</li><li style="margin:6px 0;">Practical experience with React, Angular, Node.js, Express, and TypeScript; passionate about open source engineering and quality.</li><li style="margin:6px 0;">Motivated to grow in Ubuntu release engineering: CI reliability, KPI reporting, and test automation for images, releases, and packages.</li></ul></section><footer style="margin-top:16px;font-size:12px;color:#666;"><p style="margin:0;">I look forward to hearing from you.</p></footer></div></body></html>
